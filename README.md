## Project Name & Pitch

Personal Portfolio Website

A front-end website for a fun way to share who I am as a software engineer and my experiences. Desktop and mobile compatible.

Built with HTML (Bootstrap), CSS, and Javascript. Utilized Font Awesome Icons

## Reflection

I challenged myself to create a personal website in one weekend. I recently worked on another Bootstrap project, so I was able to work efficiently. New features I learned were creating social media icons, a timeline, and a preloader.

One of the most time-consuming portions was making my images fit into its container. I wanted my column with an image to be determined by my second column of text. I was able to scale it up, but unable to scale it down if the image was too large. Eventually, I just imported a smaller image since any alteration to the image looked bad to me.
 
Overall this was a fun project to build under my self-imposed time constraint. I learned more Javascript than I anticipated I would. I will continue updating the website as my experience grows.
